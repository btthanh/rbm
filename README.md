Classification using Discriminative RBM
=======================================

A Matlab toolbox for classification using Disciminative RBM.

For a more informal introduction, see the following link by Hugo Larochelle.

* [Classification using Discriminative RBM](http://machinelearning.org/archive/icml2008/papers/601.pdf) (2008)

I used the code from:

* [DeepLearnToolbox] (https://github.com/rasmusbergpalm/DeepLearnToolbox)
* [Unsupervised Feature Learning and Deep Learning] (http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial)
as the starting point for this project.

Setup
=====

1. Download.
2. addpath(genpath('path'));
